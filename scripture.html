    It's hard to say where Garfism first originated; every year, it seems there are new relics and artefacts discovered. Scripture says Garfield was an ordinary housecat from an ancient civilisation.
This cat was elevated to godhood, with people believing the cat to be a reincarnation of their deity but eventually developing into a deity of his own.
The cat's owner, Jon, became a priest figure who would eventually go on to betray him. This was the beginning of the split between the followers of Garf and the followers of Jon.
Followers of Jon believe Garfield was possessed by an evil entity and is not a true god. This is, of course, blasphemy.
